# British-Airways-Job-Simulation

This Jupyter Notebook contains an scraping code for collecting British Airways reviews from skytrax website. I conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and derived insights from the dataset to understand passenger sentiments and preferences. The analysis includes visualizations such as histograms, correlation matrices, and insights drawn from the data. Additionally, I performed correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different review attributes such as seat comfort, cabin staff service, food & beverages, inflight entertainment, wifi & connectivity, ground service, value for money, recommendation status, and overall ratings. These insights can be valuable for British Airways in improving the customer experience and enhancing overall satisfaction.
